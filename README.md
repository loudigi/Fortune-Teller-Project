# Fortune-Teller-Project
First We Can Code IT project
## Due: Tuesday, February 14th by 5:30 PM

## Overview
Develop a console application that will tell the user’s fortune based on data received from the user.

## Tasks

### Part 1
- [ ] Ask the user for the user’s first name
- [ ] Ask the user for the user’s last name
- [ ] Ask the user for the user’s age
- [ ] Ask the user for the user’s birth month (as an 'int')
- [ ] Ask the user for the user’s favorite ROYGBIV color
  - [ ] If the user does not know what ROYGBIV is, ask them to enter “Help” to get a list of the ROYGBIV colors
- [ ] Ask the user for the number of siblings the user has

### Part 2
- [ ] If the user’s age is an odd number, then they will retire in ____ years, or ___ years if their age is an even number.
- [ ] If the user’s number of siblings is 0, then they will have a vacation home in ___(location), or 1 then they will have a vacation home in ___(location), or 2 then they will have a vacation home in ___ (location), or 3 then they will have a vacation home in ___ (location), or more than 3 then they will have a vacation home in ____ (location). If the user enters anything other than a number greater than or equal to 0, they should get a bad vacation home!
- [ ] Depending on which ROYGBIV color is the user’s favorite, they will have a specific mode of transportation (i.e. car, boat, plane, etc.) 
- [ ] If the user’s birth month is 1-4, they will have $____ in the bank; if the user's birth month is 5-8, they will have $____ in the bank; and if it is 9-12, then they will have $____ in the bank. If the user enters something other than 01-12 as their birth month, they will have $0.00 in the bank.

### Part 3
- [ ] The user’s fortune should be written as such:
  - [ ] [First Name] [Last Name] will retire in [# of Years] with [Amount of Money] in the bank, a vacation home in [Location] and a [Mode of Transportation].
- [ ] Program should be able to handle whether or not a user inputs capital or lowercase letters.

### Optional Extension Challenge:
- [ ] Give the user the ability to quit the program at any point where the program is looking for user input, by typing “Quit” (should not be case sensitive). The program should print “Nobody likes a quitter...” before ending.
